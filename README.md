Inventory tracking & point-of-sale for the CSSU.


### Overview

This is an ASP.NET MVC 5 app, consisting of two main components:

- A storefront: a public page where users can browse items sold by the CSSU, with the price, the number of items in stock, and the amount of reward cashback given.
- An administrative point-of-sale activity: CSSU members can log in and sell items (snacks/drinks/merchandise) to customers by selecting one or more items and processing the payment. The customer has the option of providing their UTORid to collect reward points. They can also view transaction history, manage customers, edit the types of items sold by the CSSU, and adjust stock levels.
